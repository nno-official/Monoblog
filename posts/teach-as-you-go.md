# Teach as You Go

Teaching is just **thinking in public**. While you build, leave a breadcrumb trail others can follow — and your future self will thank you.

## Why this works

- **Forces clarity:** if you can’t explain it, you don’t fully get it.
- **Compound impact:** one solution helps dozens of people later.
- **Career fuel:** writing builds reputation faster than resumes.

## The 15‑5‑1 cadence

- **15 minutes:** jot raw notes (what you tried, what failed, what worked).
- **5 minutes:** turn notes into a tight outline (three sections max).
- **1 minute:** publish a draft; refine later.

## Capture → Shape → Ship

1. **Capture** — dump notes in a scratch file while you work.
2. **Shape** — pick the one insight worth sharing and cut the rest.
3. **Ship** — post it now; polish is a phase, not a gate.

## Repeatable structure

```
Problem → Constraints → Attempt → Fix → What to remember next time
```

## Checklist before publish

- Title promises a single idea
- First paragraph explains why it mattered
- Code or commands are copy‑pasteable
- Links have context (what happens if I click?)
- One clear takeaway at the end

## Micro‑template

**TL;DR** — Share while building. Teaching early and often makes your work stick.
